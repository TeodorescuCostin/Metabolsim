Project Header

Due to the fact that we have three repositories one for the application, one for the API and one for smart contracts we've decided to make an repository that combines all of them.

headerApi - The first one is the API. We've made our own API so that we can have NFT's that are made in real time based on the data provided by the user. For example is we upload a picture and some text. The picture will be recived as ipfs CID and the text will not be changed. All of this data will be uploaded on web3.storage from where the API will retirve it.

headerApp - This is the second repository which contains the web app. Due to the short time frame we've made a DAO application which lets content creators to post their art or work and let the people decide which is more beautiful by giving nods and shakes. The nod and shake concept was thought about us. We've seen that the old concept of likes was a little old and we decided to rebrand it. So everytime a person likes  post it nods to it, and it dislikes it it shakes to it. Also the price is decided in an exponantial way. We didn.t made this part due to some problems but we plan to solve this as fast as we can. Now to get more technical the app basically lets creators to create NFTs from the app, because every post is an NFT and after that all the NFTs are displayed to the other users with the help of ZORAs API. Also we've used Polygon to deploy contracts and in the contracts we've included the API.

headerSmartContracts - This is the last repository which contains the Smart Contracts. Both contracts are very simple beacuse w've wanted to have something transparent.
